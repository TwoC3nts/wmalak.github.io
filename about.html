	<section class="aboutme">
		<p class="ab_info">I am a William Malak, an undergraduate of Illinois Institute of Technology. I am in the process of earning a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. In my classes, I am honing my skills in programming, data analysis, database creation and management, and software development. I experienced and continue to participate in the process of developing projects alone and in a collaborative effort with a team.</p>
		<h3 class="Y">Why I chose Computer Science</h3>
		<p class="y_info">Job possibilities are everywhere, and everyone needs to choose how they plan to live their life. I chose Computer Science. To me, Computer Science is a chance to be creative and capable in my own way. I enjoy working code and discovering how to make the different pieces fit together to solve problems. I enjoy not only the process of writing the code out, but the frustation and satisfaction that is felt when solving errors and bugs. Programming is my way of giving back to the world that has given me so much.</p>
